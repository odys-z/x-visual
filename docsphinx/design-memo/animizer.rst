Animizers
=========

Animizers convert ModelSeqs, the animation sequences scripts into Tween objects
that can be played by XTweener.

Animation scripts are a 2D array in an entity definition, ModelSeqs.script.

Sequence the Animation Structure
--------------------------------

Tween animations are organized as a 2D array, with major order the index of animation
sequences' order. Each sequence is an array of *CmpTween* component.

API Reference:

- `ModelSeqs <https://odys-z.github.io/javadoc/x-visual/XComponent.ModelSeqs.html>`_

- `CmpTweens <https://odys-z.github.io/javadoc/x-visual/XComponent.CmpTweens.html>`_

- `CmpTween <https://odys-z.github.io/javadoc/x-visual/XComponent.CmpTween.html>`_

Start Tween Sequence
--------------------

There are 3 way to start a tween animation:

1. Set start = 0 in the script, let ModelMorph start the sequence automatically.

2. Triggered by other scripts, with *startWith* & *followBy* command in script.

3. Use start command, CmpTween.startCmds. Which is an array buffering commands to
   start a sequence. It's index is the same as tween sequences' index. The following
   code start the second sequence of entity e.

::

    e.CmpTweens.startCmds.push(1);

A more elegant way to do this is use the XTweener.startSeq() API.

Mesh Animiation Script
----------------------

Example:

.. code-block:: javascript

    var cube = ecs.createEntity({
        id: 'fade-out',
        Obj3: { geom: Obj3Type.BOX,
                box: [200, 120, 80],
                mesh: undefined },
        Visual:{vtype: AssetType.mesh,
                // Three use document to load assets, which doesn't exist while testing.
                // null | undefined acts as a flag to let thrender create a ram texture.
                asset: null },

        // in version 1.0, only type of sequential animation is supported
        ModelSeqs: {
            script: [[{ mtype: AnimType.U_ALPHA,
                        paras: {start: 0,         // auto start, only alpha tween in v0.2
                                duration: 0.8,    // seconds
                                alpha: [opa0, opa1],
                                ease: XEasing.Elastic.InOut}
                    }]] },
        CmpTweens: {}
    });
..

In the above example, the entity is defined with 2 components, ModelSeqs & CmpTweens.

ModelSeqs is the animation defining animation process that animated by the x-visual's
tweening system, XTweener.

Then tweening process is record and updated in CmpTweens. It's a 2D array of CmpTween,
the equivalent of Tween object's data part in Tween.js. The methods part is moved
to XTweener, which is the style of ECS.

CmpTween and CmpTweens are wrapped by x-visual and user shouldn't worry about it.
The ModelSeqs is what users will working on, which also is defined as a 2D array.

.. note:: As x-visual is a data visualization prototype, it's only support static
    animation scripts triggered by commands. Scripts can only provided when creating
    entities, and not emit events.

- ModelSeqs

Each 1D Array of the 2D array is an animation processing script. Each element of
1D array define a duration of tween animation. The above example defined 1 process
of two tween steps.

ModleSeqs.script
----------------

mtype
+++++

The script sequence element has mtype as the first property, which can be one of
AnimType defined in component/morph.js.

AnimType
________

:ref:`AnimType<animtype>` declares supported Animation types.

Currently animation a all driven by a modified version of Tween.js module, XTweener.

X-visual is struggling to divide animations into a group of orthogonal calculations,
but not always the case.

Tests shows some animation do showing this character. The AnimType.U_MORPHi type
for example, can be combined together with more than one visual types.

AnimCate
________

mtype also has a flag indicating what kind of the animation is. Currently there
is only one special flag, AnimCate.COMBINE_AFFINE, defined in :ref:`AnimCate<animcate>`,
indicating that the animation should been handled by AffineCombiner.

See :ref:`Affine Combination <affine-design-memo>` for details.

    Delay seconds and start the the animation. If the script step is the first of
    the animation process, the animation will automatically start.

    **ISSUE**

*In the current version, start time in animation steps other than the first will
be ignored. (We are considering reorganize the Tween.js scheduling schema.)*

- startWith:

Start animation with script in other entities.

Object has same properties of :ref:`paras.followBy<script-followby>`.

AnimType.POSITION paras
_______________________

The *POSITION* animation type is used to update object's position, in world (xscnene).

- translate

A 2D array with major length = 2 specifying to position moving section. As this is an
affine transformation, it's designed as start from where it is. So the first one is
usually an array of zero vector, i. e. [0, 0, 0].

The second vector is for target position.

.. note:: From version 0.2, the target position can be dynamically updated, which
    is the only one can be updated dynamically.

    see test/html/dynamic-position-tween.html for example.

AnimType.U_ALPHA paras
______________________

- alpha:

Array of starting and ending alpha.

*U_ALPHA* is implemented as a uniform float *u_alpha*. Some vtype like :ref:`point<vtype-point>`
or :ref:`refPoint<vtype-refPoint>` are been handled by x-shader, which supporting
u_alpha uniform. There are also other types supporting u_alpha. It's planned support
u_alpha for all vtype in the future. Currently a typical THREE.Mesh without Visual.shader
configured will use THREE.Mesh.opacity for this.

U_ALPHA can apply to children::

    ModelSeqs { scrpt [ {
        mtype: xv.XComponent.AnimType.U_ALPHA,
        apply2Children: true,
        ...
      } ]
    }

The *apply2Children* parameter makes x-visual try apply parent (entity group)'s
uniform to all children. This needs both children and parent supporting U_ALPHA
as u_alpha shader uniform. In v0.3.19, these are AssetType.point, refPoint,
GeomCurve, DynaSects and ShaderFlag.randomParticles, cubeVoxels, colorArray,
colorLine.

The logic is implemented by both MorphingAnim.initTweens() && xgls.hasUAlpha().

See :ref:`test case<tst-morph-group-alpha>` for example.

The shader uniforms are:

- u_morph[i]:

This is an array of weights in between array elements. If used form morphing
between vertices, positions, the vertex positions will be mixed with all target,
the *a_target* attributes.

For a_target, See VisualType.point.

In version 0.3, there are two tests showing the usage:

test/html/morph-color.html and test/html/morph/lerp-model.html.

- u_dist:

The vertix distance to position variable, scaled with attribute noise, *a_noise*.
For a_noise, See VisualType.point.
