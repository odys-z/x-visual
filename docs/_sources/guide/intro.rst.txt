X-visual App Architecture
=========================

.. note:: Following x-visual examples readme to start up.

..

x-visual is a pure javascript ECS WebGl rendering application framework. ECS stands
for Entity, Component, System. Application should following this concept to use
x-visual effectiently.

1. x-visual startup
-------------------

X-visual is a npm package, together with a bundle can be used in plain javascript.
For quick start, see x-visual/examples readme.

X-visual using webpak. If starting with source, these 2 simple steps should work::

    npm in --save-dev
	webpack

2. Hello XWorld
---------------

Here is as simple application using x-visual for data representation.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/cube/app.js
   :language: javascript
   :lines: 1-25
   :linenos:

In the main program, the 3D world, xworld, is used as the 3D space manager.
Afther create the xworld, a cube also been created, which representing some user
data been visualized. After this, call xworld.startUpdate() and render the scene
repeatedly.

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/cube/hellocube.js
   :language: javascript
   :lines: 1-45
   :linenos:

A cube entity has been defined above, with id, Obj3, Visual components.

About System
____________

- ECS.System & ECS.XSys

ECS.System is a base class of all x-visual built-in systems, like renderer, x-view
and tween animation driver.

ECS.XSys is a base class for users to extend. It's nothing now but a coding convention.
Application systems should extends this class in case some common helping functions
added to this system in the future.

- query & update

In the *Hello XWorld* example, there is a line of code reflecting key concept of
ECS, the query condition:

.. code-block:: javascript

    Cube.query = {
        iffall: ['Visual', 'CmdFlag']
    };
..

The *iffall* is a condition specifying that all entities with all 2 components,
*Visual* and *CmdFlag* must been handled by *Cube* system.

The *update()* function is where a system handling entities at each rendering loop.
The argument *entities* is passed to it according to the *query* logics.

Examples
________

X-visual examples is a part of source repository, but also a separate webpack project.

All examples are using Webpack for transpiling. To run examples, download the source,
then install dependencies and transpile.

::

    npm i
    webpack

If everything goes well, open the examples/cube/index.html, linked page of the
first example will show a cube.

3. Common Practice of Application
---------------------------------

An x-visual application includes:

- App Main

    Main function is a common pattern of application includes creating XWorld,
    Entities then start rendering by calling xworld.startUpdate().

- Entities

    Entities are groups of Components. In x-visaul, these components are a group
    of data and System actions scripts.

- Systems

    Systems update components' state, changing how data been rendered. A user system
    can change object's position, moving path or color etc.

4. Framework Functions & API
----------------------------

Basically x-visual is not intended to be a well round data visualization framework.
It's only used to verifying some idea required by a commercial system and as a
personal arsenal for consolidating any creative thoughts.

It would been eventually useful if it could trigger any further innovation, when
math met arts.

So currently there is no more documents about it's function details, just feel
free to try it.

6. Next Step
------------

There is an independent webpack example project can be useful, see *./examples*
of `x-visual <https://github.com/odys-z/x-visual>`_.

Also test cases can be useful. Here are :ref:`some explaination<test-morph>`.
More etails is up coming ...
